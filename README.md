# March Madness Machine Learning

Final project for _INDENG 242: Applications in Data Analysis_ that predicts the final NCAA March Madness Tournament bracket. We use a logistic regression model to predict the probability that each team wins a given match-up, for all possible match-ups. Then we feed these probabilities into a simulation to predict the most likely bracket.

**A note on using R Markdown for descriptive analysis**

For recent versions of RStudio, the Knit PDF button does not seem to work. Instead, enter the following command in the Console to generate a new PDF:

``` r
render('descriptiveAnalysis.Rmd')
```
